## Welcome to my pw-generator!
My name is Chris Davis and this is my password generator!



## I would like to start with a list of things I learned on this project.
<ul>
    <li>I learned how to apply event listeners and query selectors to add input effects to the HTML elements through JavaScript</li> 
    <li>I learned how to created functions that call upon other functions and process data requested</li>
    <li>I learned how to use promt, confirm and alert comands to gather user input</li>
    <li>I learned how to take the user input, convert it to a boolean statement then use that statement to create a concat array </li>
    <li>I learned how to apply Math.random to an array and output data</li>
    <li>I learned how to return text to the #property within the HTML file from JavaScript</li>
</ul>

## Functions of my App
<ul>
    <li>When you click on the Generate Password button you will be asked multiple questions via prompt and confirm boxes.</li>
    <li>When you answer each prompt or confirm. Each of your answers will be logged.</li>
    <li>The confirm answers will then be converted to Boolean statements and be run through 'if' statements.</li>
    <li>For each true Boolean statement that respective array will be added to the allCharactersArr.</li>
    <li>allCharactersArr will include all arrays that return true statements.</li>
    <li>A for loop is then used which has a flexable characters limit being the number the user selected.</li>
    <li>The for loop then pushes its results into the blank password[] array and converts it to a string.</li>
    <li>The password string is then send to the HTML document completing the function.</li>
</ul>

## Future improvements/updates
<ul>
    <li>I would like to revisit this concept and create a similar program, but have the elements be checkboxes in a list instead of prompt/confirm boxes</li>
    <li>I will be adding this program to chris_davis_portfolio</li>
    <li>Potentially in the future I will revisit this program and add memory logic</li>
